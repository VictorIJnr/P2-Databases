P2 â€“ Front-end Design & Implementation 
======================================
### What's this nonsense?
Please don't call it nonsense it's **_very_** useful. So this ~**_NONSENSE_**~ practical is my implementation of a _website_ which streams audiobooks to its customers. Basically a poor man's Audible. However, this is no mere website, oh no. This is **_Bookstream.co.uk_** they store their customer data on my MySQL server hosted by St Andrews and I have to perform queries on the data and serve the appropriate responses to the user. Pretty standard stuff.

Welcome to v2.0.0!
------------------

### So what's changed?
In reality... not much of the **_core_** application. Rather, changes are seen in how the application is deployed. Now an `express` server is being used, with the `html` being rendered as `ejs` to allow for me to make appropriate requests, receive the results and display them to the user.

### So why v2.0.0?
Well... v1.0.0 was never a thing, but that didn't stop me from starting with v2.0.0. Anyway, a pseudo v1.0.0 can be seen as the application when it would not be sent as a response to a `GET` request to the new `express` server. That approach would not work for this practical, hence why v2.0.0. I guess. (**_That didn't really answer the question did it?_**) 

### Okay, well at least tell me how to run it
- Firstly you'll probably need to clone the repository ~no more of that GitHub Pages nonsense~
- Once cloned, go to the root folder of the project in terminal
- Then you'll need to type `npm install` to install the dependencies (**If you don't have node and npm get those first**)
- After you have the relevant dependencies, type `npm start` to start the server
- This will allow you to go to `localhost:20763` in your browser to see the website
- **_Simple Right?_**
